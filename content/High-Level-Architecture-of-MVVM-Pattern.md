To design an Android mobile app for making API calls using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, where the app logs all HTTP details (like URL, headers, request body, and response), we need to break down the architecture into logical layers that handle separation of concerns efficiently.

## Key Components of the System:
  1. **Model Layer:** Handles data and business logic, including API calls and parsing responses.
  2. **ViewModel Layer:** Acts as a mediator between the View and Model, exposing LiveData to the View.
  3. **View Layer:** The UI layer that observes the data and displays it to the user.
  4. **Repository:** This manages data sources (API calls, local storage, etc.) and abstracts the data layer from the ViewModel.
  5. **HTTP Client:** For making API calls, OkHttp (with interceptors) will be used to log requests and responses.
  6. **Logging:** To log URL, headers, request body, and response, we'll use interceptors in OkHttp.

## Detailed Design of Each Component
1. **Model Layer**
  The **Model layer** will handle all API interactions and data parsing. It includes:
   - The API service (implemented using Retrofit with OkHttp as the underlying client).
   - The data classes for requests and responses.
## Example of API Service 
```
interface ApiService {
    @GET("users")
    suspend fun getUsers(): Response<List<UserResponse>>

    @POST("login")
    suspend fun login(@Body request: LoginRequest): Response<LoginResponse>
}
```
